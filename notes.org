** Interface:

control volume on the screen

separate the agent control from the author control

** Errors

two windows - the time window stops the moment a new sound is selected
from the new winodw.


** Sounds

Different sounds for the agent and the player

Interface functions activated only after the sound is selected,
so someone might be confused what to do,

** Other things

1) User score events versus agent score events, only based on the sound
   events it is not possible to decipher how (but trivially, that can be
   done by adding another field, but interestng)

2) In the score event, sound events are ordered based on when they are
   created, not when they are played

3)
